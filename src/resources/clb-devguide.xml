        <title>Concepts</title>
        <para>To use the Rackspace Cloud Load Balancers API effectively, you should understand several key
            concepts:
        </para>
        <section>
            <title>Load Balancer</title>
            <para>A load balancer is a logical device which belongs to a cloud account. It is used
                to distribute workloads between multiple back-end systems or services, based on the
                criteria defined as part of its configuration.
            </para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Virtual IP</title>
            <para>A virtual IP is an Internet Protocol (IP) address configured on the load balancer
                for use by clients connecting to a service that is load balanced. Incoming
                connections are distributed to back-end nodes based on the configuration of the load
                balancer. </para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Node</title>
            <para>A node is a back-end device providing a service on a specified IP and port.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Health Monitor</title>
            <para>A health monitor is a feature of each load balancer. It is used to determine
                whether or not a back-end node is usable for processing a request. The load
                balancing service supports two types of health monitors: passive and active. </para>
            <section>
                <title>Passive Health Monitor</title>
                <para>By default, all load balancing configurations utilize a passive health
                    monitor. This technique analyzes the response of the back-end server to
                    determine whether or not it is capable of processing a request. Passive health
                    monitoring verifies the condition of a node using the following criteria: </para>
                <para>
                    <itemizedlist spacing="compact">
                        <listitem>
                            <para>The connection is refused by the back-end server or the connection
                                takes longer than 4 seconds to be established.
                            </para>
                        </listitem>
                        <listitem>
                            <para>The connection is closed prematurely or the beginning of the response
                                is not received within 30 seconds.
                            </para>
                        </listitem>
                        <listitem>
                            <para>An invalid HTTP response is received or a <returnvalue>503
                                    (Service Unavailable) </returnvalue> response code is received. </para>
                        </listitem>
                        <listitem>
                            <para>An SSL handshake to the back-end server (SSL passthrough) fails. </para>
                        </listitem>
                    </itemizedlist>
                </para>
                <para>If these tests fail, then the service will attempt, until every node is
                    exhausted, to locate another configured node that is capable of supporting the
                    request. If no such node is found, the requestor will receive a
                        <returnvalue>503</returnvalue> (Service Unavailable) response for HTTP
                    traffic or the connection will be dropped. </para>
                <note>
                    <para>If a given node fails a passive health monitor check three consecutive
                        times, then the service assumes the node has failed and places it in
                            <code>OFFLINE</code> status. The service will not attempt to send any
                        new requests to the node for at least 60 seconds, after which the service
                        will speculatively begin sending requests to occasionally probe the node to
                        determine whether or not it has recovered. </para>
                </note>
            </section>
            <section>
                <title>Active Health Monitor</title>
                <para>Active health monitoring is a technique that uses synthetic transactions
                    executed at periodic intervals to determine the condition of a node. One of the
                    advantages of active health monitoring is that it does not require active
                    transactions to be processed by the load balancer to determine whether or not a
                    node is suitable for handling traffic. When both active and passive monitoring
                    are enabled, the decisions made by the active monitor override inferences made
                    by the passive monitoring system. </para>
                <para>The active health monitor can use one of three types of probes:
                    <itemizedlist spacing="compact">

                        <listitem>
                            <para>
                                HTTP

                    </itemizedlist>
                    These probes are executed at configured intervals; in the event of a failure, the node
                    status changes to
                    <code>OFFLINE</code>
                    and the node will not receive traffic. If, after running a subsequent test, the probe
                    detects that the node has recovered, then the node's status is changed to
                    <code>ONLINE</code>
                    and it is capable of servicing requests.
                </para>
            </section>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Session Persistence</title>
            <para>Session persistence is a feature of the load balancing service. It attempts to
                force subsequent connections to a service to be redirected to the same node as long
                as it is online. </para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Connection Logging</title>
            <para>The connection logging feature allows logs to be delivered to a Cloud Files
                account every hour. For HTTP-based protocol traffic, these are Apache-style access
                logs. For all other traffic, this is  connection and transfer logging.</para>

        <title>General API Information</title>
        <para>Ideas explained here are relevant to all operations of the API. For details of specific API operations, see the "API Operations" chapter.</para>
        <para>The Rackspace Cloud Load Balancers API is implemented using a ReSTful web service interface.
            Like other products in the Rackspace Cloud suite, the load balancing service shares a
            common token-based authentication system that allows seamless access between products
            and services.
        </para>
        <note>
            <para>All requests to authenticate and operate the service are performed using
                HTTPS on TCP port 443.
            </para>
        </note>
        <section>
            <title>Authentication</title>
            <para>Every ReST request against the load balancing service requires the inclusion of a
                specific authorization token, supplied by the
                <code>X-Auth-Token</code>
                HTTP header. Customers obtain this token by first using the Rackspace Cloud Authentication
                Service and supplying a valid username and API access key.
            </para>
            <section>
                <title>Request</title>
                <para>The Rackspace Cloud Authentication Service serves as the entry point to all
                    Rackspace Cloud APIs and is itself a ReSTful web service. It is accessible at

            <para>The Rackspace Cloud Load Balancers API supports both the JSON and XML data serialization
                formats. The request format is specified using the
                <code>Content-Type</code>
                header and is required for operations that have a request body. The response format can be
                specified in requests using either the
                <code>Accept</code>
                header or adding an
                <code>.xml</code>
                or
                <code>.json</code>
                extension to the request URI. Note that it is possible for a response to be serialized using
                a format different from the request. If no response format is specified, JSON is the default.
                If conflicting formats are specified using both an
                <code>Accept</code>
                header and a query extension, the query extension takes precedence.

            <para>All accounts, by default, have a preconfigured set of thresholds (or limits) to
                manage capacity and prevent abuse of the system. The system recognizes two kinds of
                limits: rate limits and absolute limits. Rate limits are thresholds that are reset
                after a certain amount of time passes. Absolute limits are fixed.

                    We specify rate limits in terms of both a

                    regular expression boundary matcher '^' takes
                    effect after the root URI path. For example, the

                    <code>^/v1.0/1234/loadbalancers</code>

            <para>To conserve IPv4 address space, Rackspace highly recommends sharing Virtual IPs
                    between your load balancers. If you have at least one load balancer, you may
                    create subsequent load balancers that share a single virtual IP by issuing a
                    &POST; and supplying a virtual IP ID instead of a type. Additionally, this
                    feature is highly desirable if you wish to load balance both an unsecured and
                    secure protocol using one IP or DNS name. For example, this method makes it
                    possible to use the same load balancing configuration to support
                        <code>HTTP</code> and <code>HTTPS</code>). </para>

                    updated automatically based on state changes within the service. When a load
                    balancer is first created, it will be placed into a <code>BUILD</code> status while
                    the configuration is being generated and applied based on the request. Once the
                    configuration is applied and finalized, it will be in an <code>ACTIVE</code> status.
                    In the event of a configuration change or update, the status of the load balancer
                    will change to <code>PENDING_UPDATE</code> to signify configuration changes are in
                    progress but have not yet been finalized. Load balancers in a <code>SUSPENDED</code>
                    status are configured to reject traffic and will not forward requests to back-end
                    nodes. </para>

            <para>The nodes defined by the load balancer are responsible for servicing the requests
                received through the load balancer's virtual IP. By default, the load balancer
                employs a basic health check that ensures the node is listening on its defined port.
                The node is checked at the time of addition and at regular intervals as defined by
                the load balancer health check configuration. If a back-end node is not listening on
                its port or does not meet the conditions of the defined active health check for the
                load balancer, then the load balancer will not forward connections and its status
                will be listed as <code>OFFLINE</code>. Only nodes that are in an
                <code>ONLINE</code> status will receive and be able to service traffic from the
                load balancer. </para>
            <para>All nodes have an associated status that indicates whether the node is
                <code>ONLINE</code>, <code>OFFLINE</code>, or <code>DRAINING</code>. Only nodes
                that are in <code>ONLINE</code> status will receive and be able to service traffic
                from the load balancer. The <code>OFFLINE</code> status represents a node that
                cannot accept or service traffic. A node in <code>DRAINING</code> status represents
                a node that stops the traffic manager from sending any additional new connections to
                the node, but honors established sessions. If the traffic manager receives a request
                and session persistence requires that the node is used, the traffic manager will use
                it. The status is determined by the passive or active health monitors. </para>
            <para>If the <code>WEIGHTED_ROUND_ROBIN</code> load balancer algorithm mode is
                selected, then the caller should assign the relevant weights to the node as part of
                the weight attribute of the node element. When the algorithm of the load balancer is
                changed to <code>WEIGHTED_ROUND_ROBIN</code> and the nodes do not already have an
                assigned weight, the service will automatically set the weight to "1" for all nodes.

            <para>The load balancer usage reports provide a view of all transfer activity, average
                    number of connections, and number of virtual IPs associated with the load
                    balancing service. Current usage represents all usage recorded within the
                    preceding 24 hours. Values for both <code>incomingTransfer</code> and
                        <code>outgoingTransfer</code> are expressed in bytes transferred. The
                    optional <code>startTime</code> and <code>endTime</code> parameters can be used
                    to filter all usage. If the <code>startTime</code> parameter is supplied but the
                        <code>endTime</code> parameter is not, then all usage beginning with the
                        <code>startTime</code> will be provided. Likewise, if the
                        <code>endTime</code> parameter is supplied but the <code>startTime</code>
                    parameter is not, then all usage will be returned up to the <code>endTime</code>

            <para>The load balancing service includes a health monitoring operation which
                periodically checks your back-end nodes to ensure they are responding correctly. If

                determines that the node is functional. In addition to being performed periodically,
                the health check also is performed against every node that is added to ensure that
                the node is operating properly before allowing it to service traffic. Only one
                health monitor is allowed to be enabled on a load balancer at a time.

            <para>Session persistence is a feature of the load balancing service which
                forces multiple requests from clients to be directed to the same node. This is
                common with many web applications that do not inherently share application state
                between back-end servers.
