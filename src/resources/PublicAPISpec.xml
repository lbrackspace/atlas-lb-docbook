            <title>Load balancer</title>
            <para>
                A load balancer is a logical device, which belongs to a cloud account. It is used to distribute workloads between multiple back-end systems or services, based on the criteria defined as part of the configuration.

            <para>
                A virtual IP is an address configured on the load balancer for use by clients connecting to a service that is load balanced. Incoming connections are distributed to back-end nodes based on the configuration of the load balancer.

            <title>Health Monitor</title>
            <para>
                A health monitor is a feature of the load balancer that is used to determine whether or not a backend node is usable for processing a request.  The service supports two types of health monitors, passive and active.

            <title>Passive Health Monitor</title>
            <para>
                By default, all load balancing configurations utilize a passive health monitor, which is a technique that analyzes the response of the backend server to determine whether or not its capable of processing a request.  Passive health monitoring verifies the condition of a node using the following criteria:

            </para>
            <para>
                If the tests above fail, then the service will attempt to locate another configured node that is capable of supporting the request until every node is exhausted.  If this occurs, the requestor will receive a 503/Service Unavailable for HTTP traffic or the connection will be dropped.
            </para>
            <note>
                If a given node fails a passive health monitor check for three consecutive times, then the service assumes the node has failed and will place it in the OFFLINE status.  The service will not attempt to send any new requests to the node for at least 60 seconds after which the service will speculatively begin sending requests to occasionally probe it to determine whether or not it has recovered.

        <sect3 id="active-health-monitor">
            <title>Active Health Monitor</title>
            <para>
                Active health monitoring is a technique that uses synthetic transactions that are executed at periodic intervals to determine the condition of a node.  One of the advantages of active health monitoring is that it does not require active transactions to be processed by the load balancer to determine whether or not a node is suitable for handling traffic.  When both active and passive monitoring are enabled, the decisions made by the active monitor override inferences made by the passive monitoring system.
            </para>
            <para>
                The active health monitor can use one of three types of probes: connect, http, and https.  These probes are run at configured intervals and in the event of a failure, the node status changes to OFFLINE and the node will not receive traffic.  Once the probe has detected that the node has recovered (by running a subsequent test), then the node is changed to the ONLINE status and will be capable of servicing requests.

                Session persistence is a feature of the load balancing service that attempts to force subsequent connections to a service to be redirected to the same node as long as its online.

        <para>
            The Load Balancing Service API is implemented using a RESTful web service interface. Like other products in the Rackspace Cloud suite. The Load Balancing Service shares a common token-based authentication system that allows seamless access between products and services.
        </para>
            <note>All requests to authenticate and operate the service are performed using SSL over HTTP (HTTPS) on TCP port 443.</note>

            <title>Authentication</title>
            <para>
                Every REST request against the load balancing service requires the inclusion of a specific authorization token, which is supplied by the X-Auth-Token HTTP header. Customers obtain this token by first using the Rackspace Cloud Authentication Service and supplying a valid username and API access key.

            <para>
                <emphasis>If load balancing Cloud Servers</emphasis>, you can determine the appropriate region to select by viewing your Cloud Servers list and creating a load balancer within the same region as the data center in which your Cloud Server resides in. When your resources reside in the same region as your load balancer, it ensures your devices are in close proximity to each other and allows you to take advantage of ServiceNet connectivity for free data transfer between services.

            <title>Request/Response Types</title>
            <para>The load balancing API supports both the JSON and XML data serialization formats. The request format is specified using the
                <emphasis>Content-Type</emphasis>
                header and is required for operations that have a request body. The response format can be specified in requests using either the
                <emphasis>Accept</emphasis>
                header or adding an
                <emphasis>.xml</emphasis>

                <emphasis>.json</emphasis>
                extension to the request URI. Note that it is possible for a response to be serialized using a format different from the request (see example below). If no response format is specified, JSON is the default. If conflicting formats are specified using both an Accept header and a query extension, the query extension takes precedence.

            <title>Efficient Polling with the Changes-Since Parameter</title>
            <para>The REST API allows you to poll for the status of certain operations by performing a GET on various URIs. Rather than re-downloading and re-parsing the full status at each polling interval, your REST client may use the changes-since parameter to check for changes since a previous request. The changes-since time is specified as Unix time (the number of seconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC, not counting leap seconds). If nothing has changed since the changes-since time, a 304 Not Modified response will be returned. If data has changed, only the items changed since the specified time will be returned in the response. For example, performing a GET against https://URL/v1.0/1234/loadbalancers?changes-since=1244012982 would list all load balancers that have changed since Wed, 03 Jun 2009 07:09:42 UTC.

                        This operation asynchronously provisions a new load balancer based on the configuration defined in the request object. Once the request is validated and progress has started on the provisioning process, a response object will be returned. The object will contain a unique identifier and status of the request. Using the identifier, the caller can check on the progress of the operation by performing a GET on loadbalancers/id (for more details on this operation see the "List Load Balancer Details" section of this document). If the corresponding request cannot be fulfilled due to insufficient or invalid data, an HTTP 400 "Bad Request" error response will be returned with information regarding the nature of the failure in the body of the response. Failures in the validation process are non-recoverable and require the caller to correct the cause of the failure and POST the request again.

                        Users may configure all documented features of the load balancer at creation time by simply providing the additional elements / attributes in the request. Refer to the subsequent sections of this specification for an overview of all features the load balancing service supports.

                    Sharing Virutal IPs Between Load Balancers
                    <para>
                        In order to conserve IPv4 address space, Rackspace highly recommends sharing Virtual IPs between your load balancers. If you have at least one load balancer, you may create subsequent load balancers that share a single virtual IP by issuing a POST and supplying a virtualIp ID instead of a type. (see below for a sample request). Additionally, this feature is highly desirable if you wish to load balance both an unsecured and secure protocol using one IP / DNS name (for example, HTTP and HTTPS).

                    <note>
                        Load balancers sharing a virtual IP <emphasis>must</emphasis> utilize a unique port.

                        The nodes defined by the load balancer are responsible for servicing the requests received through the load balancers virtual IP. By default, the load balancer employs a basic "health check" that ensures the node is listening on its defined port. The node is checked at the time of addition and at regular intervals as defined by the load balancer health check configuration (for more information on health check settings, see the "Health Check" section of this document) If a back-end node is not listening on its port or does not meet the conditions of the defined health check for the load balancer, then the load balancer will not forward connections and its status will be listed as <emphasis>"OFFLINE"</emphasis>. Only nodes that are in an <emphasis>"ONLINE"</emphasis> stats will receive and be able to service traffic from the load balancer.
                    </para>
                    <para>
                        All nodes have an associated status that indicates if the node is online, offline or draining. Only nodes that are in an "<emphasis>ONLINE</emphasis>" status will receive and be able to service traffic from the load balancer. The "<emphasis>OFFLINE</emphasis>" status represents a node that cannot accept or service traffic. A node in "<emphasis>DRAINING</emphasis>" status represents a node that stops the traffic manager from sending any more new connections to the node, but honors established sessions. If the traffic manager receives a request and session persistence requires that the node is used, the traffic manager will use it. The status is determined either by the passive or active health monitors.  For more information on health monitoring, see the concepts and definitions section (above).
                    </para>
                    <para>
                        If the weighted round robin load balancer algorithm mode is selected (WEIGHTED_ROUND_ROBIN), then the caller should assign the relevant weights to the node as part of the weight attribute of the node element. When the algorithm of the load balancer is changed to weighted round robin and the nodes do not already have an assigned weight, the service will automatically set the weight to "1" for all nodes.
                    </para>
                    <para>
                        When a node is added, it is assigned a unique identifier that can be used for mutating operations such as changing the port and condition, or removing it. Every load balancer is dual homed on both the public Internet and ServiceNet and as a result, nodes can either be internal ServiceNet addresses or addresses on the public Internet.

                        A virtual IP (VIP) is how your load balancer is reached by clients. The load balancing service, supports either a public VIP, which is routable on the public Internet or a ServiceNet address, which is routable only within the region your load balancer resides in.
                    </para>
                    <note>
                        All load balancers must have at least one Virtual IP associated to them at all times. Attempting to delete the last virtual IP will result in a badRequest (400) fault.

                        The service usage provides current and a historical view of tier profiles and transfer associated with the load balancing service. Current usage represents any usage that been incurred since the endDate of the most recent historical usage object. Current usage is processed into historical usage objects every 24 hours or whenever an event occurs that changes a billing-related attribute (for example, changing the tier profiles of a load balancer). Values for both incomingTransfer and outgoingTransfer are expressed in bytes transferred.

                        The access list management feature allows for fine-grained network access controls to be applied to the load balancer's virtual IP address. A single IP address, multiple IP addresses, or entire network subnets can be added as a networkItem. Items that are configured with the <emphasis>DENY</emphasis> type will always take precedence over items with the <emphasis>ALLOW</emphasis> type. To reject traffic from all items, except for those with the <emphasis>ALLOW</emphasis> type, a networkItem with an address of "0.0.0.0/0" should be added with a <emphasis>DENY</emphasis> type.

                        When issuing a POST to add to an access list, one or more network items are required. If a populated access list already exists for the load balancer, it will be replaced with subsequent POST requests.  To append to the access list, a PUT request should be issued. Like the POST operation the PUT operation requires one or more network items. A single address or subnet definition is considered unique and cannot be duplicated between items in an access list. There are two DELETE operations for the access list. One allows for deletion of the entire access list and the other for deletion of a specific network item in the access list.

                        The load balancing service includes a health monitoring operation, which periodically checks your backend nodes to ensure they are responding correctly.  In the event that the node is not responding, it will be removed from rotation until the health check determines the node is functional. In addition to being run at periodic intervals, the health check also is run against every node that is added to ensure it is operating properly before allowing it to service traffic.  Only one health monitor is allowed to be enabled on a load balancer at a time. An overview of the supported health monitors are detailed below:

                    <para>
                        The monitor connects to each node on its defined port to ensure that the service is listening properly.  The connect monitor is the most basic type of health check and does no post-processing or protocol specific health checks.   It includes several configurable properties, which are detailed below.

                        The HTTP &amp; HTTPS monitor is a more intelligent monitor that is capable of processing a HTTP or HTTPS response to determine the condition of a node.  It supports the same basic properties as the connect monitor and includes three additional attributes that are used to evaluate the HTTP response.

                        Session persistence is a feature of the load balancing service which forces subsequent requests from clients to be directed to the same node.  This is common with many web applications that do not inheritly share application state between backend servers.

                        All load balancers utilize a "load balancer algorithm" that defines how traffic should be directed between backend nodes.  The default algorithm for newly created load balancers is Random, which can be overrided at creation time or changed after the load balancer has been initially provisioned.  The algorithm name is to be constant within a major revision of the load balancing API, though new algorithms may be created with a unique algorithm name within a given major revision of the service API.

                <para>
                    All load balancers have a status attribute to signify the current configuration status of the device. This status is immutable by the caller and is updated automatically based on state changes within the service.  When a load balancer is first created, it will be placed into a build status where the configuration is being generated and applied based on the request.  Once the configuration is applied and finalized, it will be in an ACTIVE status.  In the event of a configuration change or update, the status of the load balancer will change to PENDING_UPDATE to signify configuration changes are being made, but have not yet been finalized.  Load balancers in a suspended status are configured to reject traffic and will not forward requests to backend nodes.

                This fault indicates that there are no virtual IPs left to assign to a new loadbalancer. In practice, you should not see this fault as virtual IPs will be ordered as capacity is required, but if you do see this simply alert support so that we may make more IPs available.

                This fault is returned when the service is unavailable. For example, if the service is undergoing maintenance or otherwise unavailable.
