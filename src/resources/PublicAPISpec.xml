        <title>Concepts</title>
        <para> To use the Cloud Load Balancers API effectively, you should understand several key
            concepts:</para>
        <section>
            <title>Load Balancer</title>
            <para> A load balancer is a logical device which belongs to a cloud account. It is used
                to distribute workloads between multiple back-end systems or services, based on the
                criteria defined as part of its configuration. </para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Virtual IP</title>
            <para> A virtual IP is an IP address configured on the load balancer for use by clients
                connecting to a service that is load balanced. Incoming connections are distributed
                to back-end nodes based on the configuration of the load balancer. </para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Node</title>
            <para> A node is a back-end device providing a service on a specified IP and port. </para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Health Monitor</title>
            <para> A health monitor is a feature of the load balancer that is used to determine
                whether or not a back-end node is usable for processing a request. The service
                supports two types of health monitors: passive and active. </para>
        <section>
            <title>Passive Health Monitor</title>
            <para> By default, all load balancing configurations utilize a passive health monitor,
                    which is a technique that analyzes the response of the back-end server to
                    determine whether or not it is capable of processing a request. Passive health
                    monitoring verifies the condition of a node using the following criteria: </para>
            <para>
                <itemizedlist spacing="compact">
                    <listitem>
                        <para>The connection is refused by the back-end server or the connection
                                takes longer than 4 seconds to be established.</para>
                    </listitem>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>The connection is closed prematurely or the beginning of the response
                                is not received within 30 seconds.</para>
                    </listitem>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>HTTP: An invalid HTTP response is received or a <returnvalue>503
                                    (Service Unavailable)</returnvalue> response code is
                                received.</para>
                    </listitem>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>SSL Passthrough: The SSL handshake to the back-end server
                                fails.</para>
                    </listitem>
                </itemizedlist>
            </para>
            <para> If these tests fail, then the service will attempt to locate another configured
                    node that is capable of supporting the request until every node is exhausted. If
                    this occurs, the requestor will receive a <returnvalue>503 (Service
                        Unavailable)</returnvalue> response for HTTP traffic or the connection will
                    be dropped. </para>
            <note>
                <para>If a given node fails a passive health monitor check three consecutive times,
                        then the service assumes the node has failed and will place it in
                            <code>OFFLINE</code> status. The service will not attempt to send any
                        new requests to the node for at least 60 seconds, after which the service
                        will speculatively begin sending requests to occasionally probe it to
                        determine whether or not it has recovered. </para>
            </note>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Active Health Monitor</title>
            <para> Active health monitoring is a technique that uses synthetic transactions that are
                    executed at periodic intervals to determine the condition of a node. One of the
                    advantages of active health monitoring is that it does not require active
                    transactions to be processed by the load balancer to determine whether or not a
                    node is suitable for handling traffic. When both active and passive monitoring
                    are enabled, the decisions made by the active monitor override inferences made
                    by the passive monitoring system. </para>
            <para> The active health monitor can use one of three types of probes: 
                <itemizedlist spacing="compact">
                    <listitem>
                        <para><code>connect</code></para>
                    </listitem>
                    <listitem>
                        <para><code>HTTP</code></para>
                    </listitem>
                    <listitem>
                        <para><code>HTTPS</code></para>
                    </listitem>
                    </itemizedlist>
 These probes are executed at configured intervals; in the event of a
                    failure, the node status changes to <code>OFFLINE</code> and the node will not
                    receive traffic. If, after running a subsequent test, the probe detects that the
                    node has recovered, then the node's status is changed to <code>ONLINE</code> and
                    it is capable of servicing requests. 
            </para>
        </section>
        </section>
            <section>
            <title>Session Persistence</title>
            <para> Session persistence is a feature of the load balancing service that attempts to
                force subsequent connections to a service to be redirected to the same node as long
                as it is online. </para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Connection Logging</title>
            <para> The connection logging feature allows for Apache-style access logs (for
                HTTP-based protocol traffic) or connection and transfer logging (for all other
                traffic) to a Cloud Files account. Logs are delivered to the account every hour. </para>
        </section>
    </chapter>
    <chapter>
        <title>General API Information</title>
        <para> The Cloud Load Balancers API is implemented using a ReSTful web service interface.
            Like other products in the Rackspace Cloud suite, the load balancing service shares a
            common token-based authentication system that allows seamless access between products
            and services. </para>
            <note>
                <para> All requests to authenticate and operate the service are performed using
                HTTPS on TCP port 443. </para>
            </note>
        <section>
            <title>Authentication</title>
            <para> Every ReST request against the load balancing service requires the inclusion of a
                specific authorization token, supplied by the <code>X-Auth-Token</code> HTTP header.
                Customers obtain this token by first using the Rackspace Cloud Authentication
                Service and supplying a valid username and API access key. </para>
            
            <simplesect>
                <title>Request</title>
                <para> The Rackspace Cloud Authentication Service serves as the entry point to all
                    Rackspace Cloud APIs and is itself a ReSTful web service. It is accessible at
                        <link xlink:href="https://auth.api.rackspacecloud.com/v1.0"
                        >https://auth.api.rackspacecloud.com/v1.0</link>. To authenticate, you must
                    supply your username and API access key in x-headers: </para>

                balancer within the same region as the data center in which your Cloud Server
                resides. When your resources reside in the same region as your load balancer, it

            <title>Request/Response Types</title>
            <para>The Cloud Load Balancers API supports both the JSON and XML data serialization
                formats. The request format is specified using the <code>Content-Type</code> header
                and is required for operations that have a request body. The response format can be
                specified in requests using either the <code>Accept</code> header or adding an
                    <code>.xml</code> or <code>.json</code> extension to the request URI. Note that
                it is possible for a response to be serialized using a format different from the
                request. If no response format is specified, JSON is the default. If conflicting
                formats are specified using both an <code>Accept</code> header and a query
                extension, the query extension takes precedence. </para>
            <para> Some operations support an Atom representation that can be used to efficiently
                determine when the state of services has changed. </para>

            <para>
                Request and response body data may be encoded with gzip compression in order to accelerate interactive performance of API calls and responses. This is controlled using the <code>Accept-Encoding</code> header on the request from the client and indicated by the <code>Content-Encoding</code> header in the server response. Unless the header is explicitly set, encoding defaults to disabled.

            <title>Paginated Collections</title>
            <para> To reduce load on the service, list operations will return a maximum of 100 items
                at a time. To navigate the collection, the <code>limit</code> and
                    <code>marker</code> parameters (for example,
                <code>?limit=50&amp;marker=1</code>) can be set in the URI. If a marker 
                beyond the end of a list is given, an empty list is returned. Note that list operations
                never return <returnvalue>404 (itemNotFound)</returnvalue> faults.</para>

        <section>
            <title>Efficient Polling with the <code>Changes-Since</code> Parameter</title>
            <para>The ReST API allows you to poll for the status of certain operations by performing
                a &GET; on various URIs. Rather than re-downloading and re-parsing the full status
                at each polling interval, your ReST client may use the <code>Changes-Since</code>
                parameter to check for changes since a previous request. The
                    <code>Changes-Since</code> time is specified as Unix time (the number of seconds
                since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC, not counting leap seconds). If nothing has
                changed since the <code>changes-since</code>code> time, a <returnvalue>304 (Not
                    Modified)</returnvalue> response is returned. If data has changed, only the
                items changed since the specified time is returned. For
                example, performing a &GET; against
                    <code>https://URL/v1.0/1234/loadbalancers?changes-since=1244012982</code> would
                list all load balancers that have changed since Wed, 03 Jun 2009 07:09:42 UTC. </para>

               <title>Limits</title>
            <para>All accounts, by default, have a preconfigured set of thresholds (or limits) to 
                manage capacity and prevent abuse of the system. The system recognizes two kinds of 
                limits: rate limits and absolute limits. Rate limits are thresholds that are reset 
                after a certain amount of time passes. Absolute limits are fixed.
            </para>
            <note>
                <para>
                    If the default limits are too low for your particular application, please contact 
                    Rackspace Cloud support to request an increase. All requests require reasonable 
                    justification.

                <para>
                    We specify rate limits in terms of both a
                    human-readable wild-card URI and a
                    machine-processable regular expression. The
                    regular expression boundary matcher '^' takes
                    effect after the root URI path. For example, the
                    regular expression
                    <code>^/v1.0/1234/loadbalancers</code> would match
                    the bolded portion of the following URI:

                    <para> This operation asynchronously provisions a new load balancer based on the

                returned. The object will contain a unique identifier and status of the request.

                        fulfilled due to insufficient or invalid data, an HTTP <returnvalue>400 (Bad Request)</returnvalue> error
                response will be returned with information regarding the nature of the failure in
                the body of the response. Failures in the validation process are non-recoverable and
                require the caller to correct the cause of the failure and &POST; the request again. </para>

                <para> In order to conserve IPv4 address space, Rackspace highly recommends sharing
                Virtual IPs between your load balancers. If you have at least one load balancer, you
                may create subsequent load balancers that share a single virtual IP by issuing a
                &POST; and supplying a virtualIp ID instead of a type. Additionally, this feature is
                highly desirable if you wish to load balance both an unsecured and secure protocol
                using one IP / DNS name (for example, HTTP and HTTPS). </para>

                    <para> The nodes defined by the load balancer are responsible for servicing the
                requests received through the load balancer's virtual IP. By default, the load
                balancer employs a basic health check that ensures the node is listening on its
                defined port. The node is checked at the time of addition and at regular intervals
                as defined by the load balancer health check configuration. If a back-end node is
                not listening on its port or does not meet the conditions of the defined active
                health check for the load balancer, then the load balancer will not forward
                connections and its status will be listed as <code>OFFLINE</code>. Only nodes that
                are in an <code>ONLINE</code> status will receive and be able to service traffic
                from the load balancer. </para>
                    <para> All nodes have an associated status that indicates whether the node is
                online, offline, or draining. Only nodes that are in an <code>ONLINE</code> status
                will receive and be able to service traffic from the load balancer. The
                    <code>OFFLINE</code> status represents a node that cannot accept or service
                traffic. A node in <code>DRAINING</code> status represents a node that stops the
                traffic manager from sending any additional new connections to the node, but honors
                established sessions. If the traffic manager receives a request and session
                persistence requires that the node is used, the traffic manager will use it. The
                status is determined by the passive or active health monitors. </para>
                    <para> If the <code>WEIGHTED_ROUND_ROBIN</code> load balancer algorithm mode is
                selected, then the caller should assign the relevant weights to the node as part of
                the weight attribute of the node element. When the algorithm of the load balancer is
                changed to <code>WEIGHTED_ROUND_ROBIN</code> and the nodes do not already have an
                assigned weight, the service will automatically set the weight to "1" for all nodes. </para>
                    <para> When a node is added, it is assigned a unique identifier that can be used
                for mutating operations such as changing the port and condition or removing it.
                Every load balancer is dual-homed on both the public Internet and ServiceNet;  as a
                result, nodes can either be internal ServiceNet addresses or addresses on the public
                Internet. </para>

                    <para> The access list management feature allows for fine-grained network access
                controls to be applied to the load balancer's virtual IP address. A single IP
                address, multiple IP addresses, or entire network subnets can be added as a
                networkItem. Items that are configured with the <code>ALLOW</code> type will always
                take precedence over items with the <code>DENY</code> type. To reject traffic from
                all items, except for those with the <code>ALLOW</code> type, a networkItem with an
                address of "0.0.0.0/0" should be added with a <code>DENY</code> type. </para>
                    <para> When issuing a &POST; to add to an access list, one or more network items
                are required. If a populated access list already exists for the load balancer, it
                will be appended with subsequent &POST; requests.  A single address or subnet
                definition is considered unique and cannot be duplicated between items in an access
                list. There are two &DELETE; operations for the access list. One allows for deletion
                of the entire access list and the other for deletion of a specific network item in
                the access list. </para>

                <title>Load Balancer Status</title>
                <para> All load balancers have a status attribute to signify the current
                configuration status of the device. This status is immutable by the caller and is
                updated automatically based on state changes within the service. When a load
                balancer is first created, it will be placed into a build status where the
                configuration is being generated and applied based on the request. Once the
                configuration is applied and finalized, it will be in an <code>ACTIVE</code> status.
                In the event of a configuration change or update, the status of the load balancer
                will change to <code>PENDING_UPDATE</code> to signify configuration changes are in
                progress but have not yet been finalized. Load balancers in a <code>SUSPENDED</code>
                status are configured to reject traffic and will not forward requests to back-end
                nodes. </para>

        <title>API Faults</title>
        <para>
            API calls that return an error will return one of the following fault objects.  All fault objects will extend from the base fault, <code>serviceFault</code>, for easier exception handling for languages that support it.
        </para>
        <section>
            <title><code>serviceFault</code></title>
            <para>
                The <code>serviceFault</code> and by extension all other faults include <code>message</code> and <code>detail</code> elements which contain strings describing the nature of the fault 
                as well as a <code>code</code> attribute representing the HTTP response code for convenience. 
                The <code>code</code> attribute of the fault is for the convenience of the caller so that they may retrieve the response code from the HTTP response headers 
                or directly from the fault object if they choose. 
                The caller should not expect the <code>serviceFault</code> to be returned directly but should instead expect only one of the child faults to be returned.
